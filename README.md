## Linked List
1. Merge two sorted linked list in place i.e space complexity of O(1)
2. Exchange the adjacent nodes of a singly linked list
3. Reverse a linked list in pairs. If you have a linked list that holds 1->2->3->4->5, then it should return 
2->1->4->3->5
4. Josephus Circle: N people have decided to elect a leader by arranging themselves in a circle and eliminating every Mth person around the circle,closing ranks as each person drops out. Find which person will be the last one remaining.

## Queue,Stacks and Binary Trees
5. Print the post order traversal of a binary tree without using recursion.
6. Find the height of a binary tree without using recursion
7. Find the maximum element of a binary tree without using recursion.
8. Print the element of a binary tree in Bottom to Top and Left to Right order.
9. Give an algorithm for checking the existence of a path from root with given sum.
